# Machine-Learning

CERC data: https://github.com/bgpurzycki/Evolution-of-Religion-and-Morality/blob/master/Wave%20I/CERC%20Wave%20I%20Materials%20Version%206.0.pdf

Re-analysis of CERC dataset (Evolution of religion and morality) with machine learning methods such as regularized regression, Decision Tree, and black box methods such as Random Forest.
Concluded similar results from conventional methods (goodness of fit with hypothesis testing): Belief in punishment from Moralistic God is the most significant predictor for fair allocation of coins
However, machine learning methods reveals the inadequacy of conventional statistical methods: belief in punishment from moralistic God can explain but not predict prosocial behavior. Analysis with machine learning methods shows that belief in punishment from moralistic God fails to predict prosocial behavior in other sample.
